# lambdasmiter
A universal function for browser javascript loosely based on occamsfuncer (which is already well tested but too slow). Like hitting the halting-problem with Thor's hammer, it smites infinite loops etc 1 million times faster than the competition. Get creative. Have fun. Build things together, defended by lambdasmiter so your browser tab cant crash even if you try to run an infinite loop etc. Can in theory smite through 100,000 infinite loops per second (compared to the usual 0 to 0.1 per second) then get back to your cat memes and multiplayer gaming experiments without missing a step, without delaying the next video frame of the game, without your mouse or text cursor feeling jumpy, and especially for AI experiments where AIs write experimental code to create new AIs and people and AIs play and build together and share lambdas across the internet similar to how most apps share byte streams, except the lambda, not the byte, is the unit of computing here. Its a workaround for the halting problem which smites any lambda call reliably when its about to, or sometimes can be known that it would later, use more memory or compute cycles etc than its allocated thousands per second of such recursive limits within limits per stack height, in a subset of pure functional browser javascript with GPU optimizations and gaming low lag canvas pixels and game controllers and textareas and p2p etc, and whole or sparse system state (stateless lambdas, including Float64Array, in lazy merkle forest) is saveable and loadable in byte arrays, and random or malicious or just fun experimental code shared across the internet can be run safely together in a tiny fraction of a second.
